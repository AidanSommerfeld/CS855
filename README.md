## About
Habit Tracker is a reminders and task keeping app developed for Android that helps you keep your schedule and track your assignments, deadlines, and chores. Habit Tracker features daily and weekly overviews of tasks to let you know what's coming up, helping you to prioritize your time accordingly.

### Reminder 
A reminder is a task that renews every day. Every reminder has a time it should be completed, and a title. It can fall into one of four categories: 
- Meals: any time you want to remember to eat during the day. It can be used for meals and snacks
- Water: the times you want to remember to drink water during the day
- Meds: reminders of when to take your medications
- Exercise: reminders to move, or workouts
Since reminders are daily tasks, they can only be edited during that day, and become unchangable at the start of the next day. 

### Task
A task is anything that has a deadline and can be completed over the course of one or many days. These show up in the daily tasks, and the weekly tasks screens.
