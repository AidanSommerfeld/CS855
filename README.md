 ## Description
This app will be set up with 3 main views. The daily tracker, weekly tracker, and monthly tracker. 
These views allow the user to prioritize and organize their reminders and tasks based on each view. 

Reminders are prebuilt templates that allow the user to quickly manage their normal tasks.

Tasks are user defined tasks that show up in a todo list. These tasks can be scheduled and prioritized with the long term or short term tag. 

Short term tags will have a higher priority than long term tags, but as the deadline for the long term task gets closer, it will gain a higher priority.
