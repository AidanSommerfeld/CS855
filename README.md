## About
Habit Tracker is a reminders and task keeping app developed for Android that helps you keep your schedule and track your assignments, deadlines, and chores. Habit Tracker features daily and weekly overviews of tasks to let you know what's coming up, helping you to prioritize your time accordingly.

### Reminder 
A reminder is a task that renews every day. Every reminder has a time it should be completed, and a title. It can fall into one of four categories: 
- Meals: any time you want to remember to eat during the day. It can be used for meals and snacks
- Water: the times you want to remember to drink water during the day
- Meds: reminders of when to take your medications
- Exercise: reminders to move, or workouts
Since reminders are daily tasks, they can only be edited during that day, and become unchangable at the start of the next day. 

### Task
A task is anything that has a deadline and can be completed over the course of one or many days. These show up in the daily tasks, and the weekly tasks screens.

### Weekly
The weekly page shows all of the [tasks](#task) that the user has set for the current calendar week. The user has a few ways to interact with this page:

#### View and Edit all weekly tasks
Each task that the user has created over the course of the calander week will appear here. Anything before the beginning of sunday this week, or the end of saturday this week will not show up on this page. The user can add new tasks, rename tasks, or delete tasks here. 

#### View the daily progress for each day of the week
Each day has a vertical progress bar. This shows the number of completed tasks for each day. When a user taps on this, they are taken to the history page. This page displays an overview consisting of the date, the number of tasks for the day, and a list of finished and unfinished tasks. On this page, the user can check or uncheck tasks, but they cannot edit the tasks.
